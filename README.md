## Instructions

This project demontrates a dynamically built nav bar according to however many sections are on the landing page. In addition to that, once you click a section in the navbar, your page will scroll to that section for you. One thing that can be added later is a button that'll open a modal where you can create a section title & fill out the content. once clicking the submit button, the section will be created and will be added to the nav bar with scrolling capability.
